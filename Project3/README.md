Project 3

To run this program, make sure that Python3 is installed and working. You can validate this by running in your command prompt on Windows or Linux:

python --version

Now, from the directory you saved the script to, run the program using Python

python portchecker.py

The point of this program is to check if a specified port is open at a specified websiite. This can be useful for testing email server setups or ssh ports for a remote server, or any infinite number of reasons to check networks for open ports.

The program will start by asking you to input a website address. It will then ask you for a port number to check the status of. Once you input those two things, it will reach out and check the status and return that status to you.
